As you can see I am not fully done with the CommonCore yet but I am already pretty far. My goal is to finish in the 4th quarter of 2024 and to then apply for internships. But After my internship I still want to do a lot of the specialization projects.

## Overview of the Projects

**Libft**
Libft is a project where you make a standard library with functions you will use a lot over the whole CommonCore. For the project we first need to restrict us to the subject but later we can add any functions we want to it. Mine is still pretty stock because I never had the need to extend it a lot.

**Printf**
Printf is a very basic project and still making a function actually. In this project we need to remake the Printf function with some basic format specifiers. This project isn't that challenging but it is the first project we have in the commonCore that requires us to create multiple files and link them together. We also learn the concepts of variadic functions. This can be really helpfull for later on.

**Born2Beroot**
Virtual machines and servers. Always a handy concept to have in your arsenal. In this project we are reached how to set up a server with Debian (Other options like Rocky are also allowed). It also teaches us a bit about security and password policies. Some basic stuff like Sudo and APT are also talked about. In general this project isn't that hard and the bonus of it lets you setup your own Wordpress website if this is something you are interested in.

**Get_Next_Line**
The first real challenge. Not an easy project at all. Get next line makes us write a function we can call later on in the CommonCore to read from files and return the output to a string line per line. This project teaches us a bit about File I/O and teaches us some new functions to use (read, open and close). We also need to use static variables for the first time to safe the buffer state between function calls.

**Push_Swap**
Push swap is the first real project that doesn't just let us make a function we can use later. The goal of the project is to make a sorting algorithm that only has a very limited amount of moves and we need to sort a list of integers from low to high in the lowest amount of moves possible. A project where you can really get to know how to optimize your code. This project is hated by some but loved by others. I personally liked it a lot but I have to admit it is not an easy project.

**Pipex**
A feature not a lot of people outside of the UNIX space know of it the ability to pipe commands togheter. Take the output from one command as the input to another is useful in so many cases. But at 42 we don't like to use stuff that we don't know how it works. So the solution for that? Remake pipes in a small project called Pipex. It is not a big project but for a lot of people really challenging. The new functions you learn are handy for the future projects  but error handling in this project is really handy. The smallest of mistakes can really start to mess stuff up. At the end of the day a project you learn a lot on.

**FdF**
 So far one of my favorite projects of the CommonCore. FdF lets you make a 3d map wireframe viewer. You get a bunch of files with maps in and you need to read them and make a nice graphical program for them. The graphical part is handled by MinilibX (X11 under the hood). So not one of the fancy options like Vulcan or openGL but still really powerful in the right hands. The only thing Minilibx isn't great at is performance but this is not the biggest deal breaker yet. The bonus of this project is super nice and also lets you make it so you can rotate the map and zoom in. Sadly I didn't do the bonus but I will revisit this project and do it that time.
